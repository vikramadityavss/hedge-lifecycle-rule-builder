## Remaining Implementation Gaps

| Category | Component | Implementation Gap |
|----------|-----------|--------------------|
| UI Enhancement | Rule Builder Component | No JSON validation for MODIFY_HEDGE parameters - could lead to runtime errors if invalid JSON is entered |
| Implementation Gap | Rule Service | No specialized handling for date types in convertConditionToJsonLogic method |
| Test Coverage | Test Files | Limited test coverage - only basic tests implemented |
| Implementation Gap | Rule Service | Limited error handling for rule execution failures |
| UI Enhancement | Rule Builder Component | No form validation for condition values based on field type |

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Rule Service

The rule service implementation had several missing condition operator implementations, which could have led to runtime errors when users select these operators in the UI. The fixed implementation now properly handles all defined operators.

### 2. Rule Builder Component

The rule builder component's dropdown options were incomplete, preventing users from accessing all available operators. The fixes ensure all operators defined in the model are now available in the UI.

### 3. MODIFY_HEDGE Action UI

The UI implementation for MODIFY_HEDGE action type was missing, despite being defined in the model and service. This has been added to allow users to specify hedge modification parameters.

### 4. Test Coverage

Several test files were missing, limiting the project's test coverage. Basic test files have been created, but more comprehensive test coverage is still needed.

## Recommendations

1. **Implement JSON Validation**: Add validation for MODIFY_HEDGE parameters to prevent runtime errors.
2. **Enhance Date Handling**: Implement specialized handling for date types in rule conditions.
3. **Expand Test Coverage**: Add more comprehensive test cases, especially for rule evaluation.
4. **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance error handling for rule execution failures.
5. **Add Form Validation**: Implement form validation for condition values based on field type.
